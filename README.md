# Reflection on Personal Resume Website Development

## Design Choices:
I chose a minimalistic design with a dark header and green navigation bar for a professional look. The layout focuses on showcasing the content cleanly, with a large header to emphasize my name and navigation links. I also used responsive design to ensure the site works well on mobile devices.

## Challenges Faced:
One challenge was making the website responsive across all screen sizes. I had to learn how to use **CSS media queries** and **Flexbox** to adjust the layout and make it more user-friendly on mobile devices. Another challenge was figuring out how to keep the navigation bar fixed at the top as the user scrolls down.

## Lessons Learned:
Through this project, I learned the importance of **responsive design** and how to create layouts that work well on both mobile and desktop. I also learned how to host websites using **GitHub Pages**. This experience taught me how to focus on **user experience** and how to structure a personal website effectively.
