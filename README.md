Reflection on Personal Resume Website Development
Design Choices:

For my personal resume website, I opted for a minimalistic design to maintain a clean and professional appearance. I used a dark-colored header combined with a green navigation bar to create a visually appealing contrast. The layout emphasizes simplicity and readability, with a large header showcasing my name and organized navigation links for easy access. I also incorporated responsive design techniques to ensure the website functions smoothly across different screen sizes, especially on mobile devices.

Challenges Faced:

One of the main challenges I encountered was making the website fully responsive. It required me to learn and apply CSS media queries and Flexbox, which were initially difficult to grasp. Ensuring consistent layout and spacing across various screen sizes took several rounds of testing and adjustments. Another challenge was implementing a fixed navigation bar that stays visible as the user scrolls, which involved tweaking positioning and z-index properties.

Lessons Learned:

This project greatly improved my understanding of web development fundamentals. I learned the importance of responsive design and how to adapt layouts for both desktop and mobile users. I also gained experience with hosting a website using GitHub Pages, which was a valuable step in understanding deployment. Overall, the process taught me how to prioritize user experience and structure a personal website in a way that is both functional and visually engaging.
